# people-location-api

The people-location-api ("The API") is a public API which can be used to retrieve lists of people who are living in London or people whose coordinates are currently within 50 miles of London. This API calls the bpdts test app API to fetch the source user and city data it needs. Full instructions can be found at http://bpdts-test-app.herokuapp.com/instructions.

## Disclaimer
This API has been developed entirely by me Aminur Rouf (also known as nar25 when doing GitHub commits).

## Live Demo

A live demonstration of the API can be found at https://people-location-api.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html (assuming I have enough Azure monthly credits to keep the meter running).
